<!-- The following text is all placed in <p> tags. These are a summary about the owner and about his business -->
<!--<p>I am Jack Overcash, the owner and founder of ChrisKay Treasures. I am based out of Goldsboro,
    North Carolina. Since I was a little boy I have always enjoyed collecting antiques. In recent
    years I have gotten into collecting limited clothing items and hard to find collectibles. I
    travel the country looking for the most interesting items to add my collection. I have now
    found a way to share what I love with people from all over the world. This website gives people
    an inside look at my collection and some of the items I am selling.</p>
<p>Another hobby of mine is taking photographs. My love of photography began when I was a teenager
    entering my photos in the contest at the local county fair. I now have decided to share my
    photography skills with others. There are many creative ways I have found to do this. Some
    of the ways is through private photo shoots or taking pictures throughout important personal
    events. My photography can also be printed on many different types of items.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy exploring the things I love as much as I enjoy doing and collecting these things.
    Feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.</p>-->
